<H1>LUIS'S MOVIE RANK!</H1>
<H2>MY TOP 3 MOVIES OF ALL TIME</H2>
<hr/>
<h3>SCAREFACE</h3>
<p>This is one of my all time favorite movies, mainly because of the ambition that tony has in order to overcome poverty and move forward. I know his ways are not the best but it still inspires a go getter attitude in me which I can appreciate.</p>
<h3>HAROLD AND KUMAR GO TO WHITE CASTLE</h3>
<p>This one changed my life in a wierd way. I watched it very young probably at age 13 and it changed my way of seeing comedy. I fell in love with the stoner community and eventually became one myself hahaha XD, but in a positive side I believe it helped my sense of humor to evolve. Must watch for anyone trying to get a good laught :)</p>
<h3>GOODFELLAS</h3>
<p>Yes! Another gangster movie! Not sure if this is a guy thing or not but we love to see men take over and whoop some ass while making money in the process haha. One of the best italian mob stoires of all time without a doubt, real movie lovers know not to skip this one.</p>
