<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, I’m Luis Gonzalez—former Latin Grammy and Grammy-nominated music producer turned web developer. I spent years creating hits in the studio, and now I’m crafting something just as powerful on the web. In my 30s, I discovered coding and realized it wasn’t just a skill—it’s a passion. The same energy that drove my music career now fuels my journey in web development.<p>
  
</p>

  I thrive on solving problems and creating experiences, whether it’s in music or in code. My background as a producer taught me how to think outside the box, work under pressure, and collaborate to get things done—skills that translate perfectly into building dynamic, user-focused websites.<p>

</p>  
<p>I may be newer to the development world, but make no mistake: I’ve put in the work, learned the craft, and I’m ready to bring my unique perspective to your project. Whether you need a clean, modern site or something bold and interactive, I’m here to make it happen. Let’s create something that not only looks amazing but functions flawlessly—because when I work on your website, I don’t just build it. I elevate it. </p>
